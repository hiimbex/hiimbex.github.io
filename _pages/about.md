Hi, I'm Bex.

I am a software engineer and artist seeking to make the world a better place through open source and the uplifting of underrepresented groups in tech.

I've worked at GitHub for a bit, and created [behaviorbot](https://github.com/behaviorbot) and maintain and build [probot](https://probot.github.io/).

Check out a [talk I gave about Probot](https://vimeo.com/287507595)

All artwork belongs to me.
