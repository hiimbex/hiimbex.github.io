I"ƒ<p>Hello. This blog post is a journey of self discovery discussing how I source inspiration for my artwork.</p>

<h1 id="sourcing-inspiration">Sourcing Inspiration</h1>

<h3 id="the-presence-or-absence-of-contentment">The presence or absence of contentment?</h3>
<p>I am more likely to be inspired by the absence of contentment, as it is something I have long been familiar with. I have a deep running desire to seek out contentment and have found enjoyment of art a large part of it.</p>

<h3 id="interactions-with-humans-or-non-humans">Interactions with humans or non-humans?</h3>
<p>I think I am more likely to be inspired by interactions with humans than non-humans. I am extremely close with my cat; however, I donâ€™t feel she plays a very major role in my artistic or creative process. The people in my life certainly influence my way of thinking in ways that cannot be detached from my art.</p>

<h3 id="culture-or-nature">Culture or nature?</h3>
<p>I think I am more likely to be inspired by nature as opposed to culture. In nature in particular, I find myself constantly drawn to the ocean and water as well as trees as both symbolic and literal things of beauty. I think I struggle to be inspired by culture and feel often a disconnect between my work interests and current popular culture.</p>

<h3 id="familiarity-or-mystery">Familiarity or mystery?</h3>
<p>I think I am more likely to be inspired by familiarity as it provides existing feelings to work with. I think that new notions can become a part of my artistic process; however, new meaning something that may soon become familiar or has become no longer unknown and lost its mysterious aspect.</p>

<h3 id="facts-or-feelings">Facts or feelings?</h3>
<p>I think I am more likely to be influenced by feelings than facts when it comes to my artwork. At a certain level, when drawing a book, yes the book itself contains facts: a cover, pages, the desk it sits on; however, in a drawing it is more important to capture the essence and feel of the books existence than to render its facts precisely on the page.</p>

<h3 id="anger-or-pity">Anger or pity?</h3>
<p>I think I am more likely to be inspired by pity than anger. As a person, I find it more natural to be empathetic and attempt to understand and respect other people than become angry. I definitely experience anger, but I attempt to reason through it more often than not, since thereâ€™s little anger can do for me productively.</p>

<h3 id="yourself-or-others">Yourself or others?</h3>
<p>I think more often than not I find my inspiration from myself as opposed to others. Others certainly influence my thinking and understanding from the world in ways that even I may not be aware of; however, I think that when I truly rediscover creativity it comes from myself and inward thought and reflection. While that thought and reflection is certainly influence by others, it is digested and rediscovered by only myself.</p>
