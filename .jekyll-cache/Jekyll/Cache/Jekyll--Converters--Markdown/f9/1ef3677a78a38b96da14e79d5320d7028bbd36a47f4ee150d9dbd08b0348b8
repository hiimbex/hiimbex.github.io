I"ه<p>Hello and happy almost 2022! I wanted to document and share my journey of becoming obsessed with puzzling during the pandemic. Since then I have completed nearly 100 jigsaw puzzles, primarily around 1000 pieces each. What started as a way to kill time, turned into a love and joy for the simple act of solving jigsaw puzzles. From discovering that Goodwill in Michigan sells puzzles for $1 to pulling relics from the back of my childhood home’s attic, this experience has been nothing short of wonderful since the beginning.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell this story with photos of the puzzles I’ve completed as well as some memories made along the way. It is quite long since it includes nearly a hundred photographs of puzzles, but I highly recommend for some rainy day entertainment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/1.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
As a kid I did make puzzles, but this puzzle was the first one I completed in March of 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. I was living alone in San Francisco and very afraid of Covid-19. I spent almost no time outside of my apartment and decided to order two 1000 piece puzzles on Amazon to have something to do. I loved this puzzle given the variety of color and texture. It made for an excellent return/start to puzzling.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/2.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
If you can’t tell by now, I do quite like cats. This was the second puzzle from my Amazon delivery, and I really enjoyed the beach time vibes. The colors and unique elements made it highly enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/3.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This puzzle was one of the more unique ones I’ve done. It was a puzzle my family owned since I was a child, and my parents mailed it to me as a “covid relief” care package to lift my spirits. I’m not sure where we got it, but it is entirely holographic, meaning the kites appear to shift as you move it. This does not make for a particularly easy puzzling experience, but it certainly is fun to look at!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/4.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Not long after completing the holographic puzzle, I made the difficult decision in May of 2020 to return home for my mental and emotional well being. Living alone during the pandemic was extremely difficult for me. I was also lucky that my job was fully remote and supported me in this temporary relocation. This throw-back foods puzzle was the first I did in Grand Haven with my mom. It belonged to my Aunt and she left us borrow and complete it. It was fun hearing from my mom which of these foods she loved growing up, since many were unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/5.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was also a loaner from my Aunt and a lovely sea-scape. This one was actually a bit tricky given the blue regions that are difficult to distinguish, but nothing some determination couldn’t tackle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/6.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This 1500 piece black and white puzzle of the art of M. C. Escher almost broke me. This was far and away the largest and most difficult puzzle I had done to date. An addition of 500 pieces, might not seem like much, but that combined with the lack of color and lack of distinct sections made for an extremely difficult puzzle. The bottom 1/3 we completed relatively quickly, but those birds fading into the sky because quite a drawn out process. The image itself is lovely. It is a reflection of itself in inverted black and white colors, creating a fascinating illusion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/7.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After the pain that was the Escher puzzle, we relaxed with this smaller 500 piece beach chair puzzle. Each chair was only a dozen or so pieces, making for quick, satisfying work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/8.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Up next was a puzzle I believe was brought back to my Aunt from my cousin after her semester abroad in Dublin. It depicts a lovely coast; however, the actual image quality of the printing on the puzzle was quite poor, leading to intense pixelation that made puzzling slower.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/9.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was one I had spotted on my Aunt’s shelf and been particularly excited to borrow. It depicts a crowded snowy downtown which I thought was lovely. It was great fun getting to put together all the highly patterned buildings and place the people in the correct positions as we built out the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/10.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next candy puzzle was also borrowed from my Aunt - she had quite a nice collection we got to complete!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/11.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was the first puzzle we did after we ran out of convenient family-supplied puzzles. This was also our first Ravensburger puzzle, a brand that, amongst puzzlers, carries a great deal of respect and weight. Ravensburger puzzles are very consistent and very high quality. This particular one, although its photo does not do it justice, represented a very humours book store, with dozens of funny phrasings available to be read on even the tiniest of books. It was quite amusing when putting it together to read something like “Cure for Bats” and have the rest of the joke be cut off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/12.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Shortly after completing our first Ravensburger, my mom had the brilliant idea to hit up the Grand Haven Goodwill to search for some less expense options for puzzles. It is rather difficult to justify spending $20-30 for a puzzle with the intention of only completing it once. At this point it might be important to point out that our family has no tradition of gluing or framing puzzles and we tend to take them apart as soon as they’ve sat finished for day. We also do not subscribe to the bizarre, fringe group of puzzle who believe using the box is “cheating”.</p>

<p>This was our first official puzzle “haul” – we should have made an unboxing video! The bizarreness of this particular grouping of puzzles will hopefully not go unnoticed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/13.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After much discussion, we selected one of the simpler landscape puzzles to complete first. These puzzles aren’t really my favorites. I find the images rather unimaginative and the process for putting them together rather tedious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/14.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up came another Amazon delivery of a 500 piece Baby Yoda puzzle! It was immediately prioritized above the Goodwill puzzles. At the time the Mandalorian had just come out and my mom and I were rightfully obsessed with Baby Yoda. This puzzle was fun, but unfortunately the image quality was very low, resulting in some pretty dreadful levels of pixelation in the printed puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/15.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The next puzzle was certainly a legendary one and left me questioning many things about the universe. Who decides what goes on a puzzle? Do those people get paid? Is the person who picked the image for this puzzle different than the person responsible for the text selection? Did they ever meet one another? Would they have been friends or mortal enemies? These are very important questions for which we, unfortunately, never received answers. All I can hope is that the poor squirrel in the image is not as overworked as the corporate American I image screaming that diatribe.</p>

<p>This puzzle was also hair pulling-ly difficult Every single piece was identical and fit together with every other piece. I can’t tell you how many mistakes we had to undo and fix halfway through a section. Even at the end I remained convinced that there was a mistake in the top left quadrant. If you look closely at the orange and black areas, doesn’t something just seem… off?</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/16.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was completed on a folding card table during a brief weekend back in Chicago. The semi-plush surface of the card table made this a painful exercise. Puzzles are meant to be done on hard surfaces. My mom and I did discuss buying a puzzling board of sorts, but never pulled the trigger on buying one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/17.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was another from the Goodwill batch and completed back in Grand Haven. It was our first (but certainly not last) used puzzle that we found to have missing pieces. A lot of people did ask me if Goodwill puzzles could be trusted at all to have pieces, and I will say that the vast majority of puzzles we got from Goodwill were entirely complete, and there were very few with truly egregious amounts of missing pieces. This particular puzzle was fun initially to build the tree trunks up, but quickly became a tedious guess and check effort to fill in the remaining forestry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/18.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Up next was a childhood favorite brought from our pantry. We have no records of when we misplaced that single piece and are highly distraught over that loss. Lord of the Rings was an obsession amongst the whole family growing up. I was thoroughly shamed for being the only one not to have read the books.</p>

<p>I remember when I was young and the final Lord of the Rings movie came out, my parents had to see it in theaters without my brother and I to decide if we would be allowed to see it. At 10 and 6 respectively, we saw the Return of the King in theaters. Quite frankly I watched a lot of movies that perhaps I was too young for, but Lord of the Rings didn’t leave much of an impression. The Matrix on the other hand did. Apparently 5 year old me watched the opening scene and turned to my dad and said, wide-eyed, “she’s <em>GOOD</em>”. Trinity was, indeed, good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/19.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle is also one of the ones which posses an image that evokes an unexpected sense of existentialism. Its meaning goes over my head; however, its ghost wolves were certainly fun to put together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/20.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next beautifully horsey was primarily worked on by my mom, as I found the background disillusioning to work on. This was unfortunately another Goodwill puzzle with several missing pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/21.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Here’s a sneak peak of our summer puzzle stack that year, which was nearly completed, prompting another Goodwill visit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/22.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
And boy oh boy did this particular Goodwill visit blow my mind!! Did anyone else in the universe know that they sold puzzle PACKS that contained multiple unique puzzles! This was an absolutely revolutionary discovery that really changed my outlook on puzzling. What is increasingly bizarre is the “theme” of this puzzle box which at first glance appears to be Italy. Then you notice there’s one from Sevilla, Spain, and then you notice one is also a painting, and then you notice one is just some female lions and start to question why you thought it was Italian, before you double check, that yes, in fact, all seven other images are indeed Italian.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/23.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Here’s what the inside of the legendary 10 Deluxe Jigsaw Puzzles box looked like. Not all of the puzzles were opened by the previous owner, but there were a few loose pieces floating around. We did find all the pieces for all of these puzzles and were left scratching our heads with an extra!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/24.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The same Goodwill trip that provided the 10 deluxe puzzle pack, also brought home this adorable treasure, only 500 pieces I chose to work on this one first since I adored the frame it had.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/25.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
My first pick of the deluxe box was this somewhat bizarrely organized image featuring various European (primarily Italian, but not exclusively) motifs. I liked the idea of all the different unique sections, but frankly it made for too easy of a puzzle and was completed before I knew it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/26.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was another house puzzle that features some highly questionable roofing architecture. I mean look closely, it really is confusing - every house has a different connection element and even slightly different initial roof heights.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/27.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up we took on the Milan Duomo. Now I have been to the Milan Duomo and highly question the caption’s accuracy given there is no bridge leading up to the Duomo. Some googling led me to discover that this is in fact a terrace and you can go up there - missing opportunity for me. This one was rather tedious as well given the giant mass of blue sky and repetitive pilar structures.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/28.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up is an interruption in the deluxe puzzle series due to a birthday gift for my mom in September. I remembered how much she enjoyed the first old-timey food puzzle, so I picked this one out. This puzzle was memorable for its unique puzzle piece shapes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/29.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next we returned to Italy for the poorly photographed Trevi Fountain. Here’s an obligatory photo of my mom and I at the Trevi Fountain together. 
<img src="/images/posts/puzzles/trevi.JPG" style="width:750px;" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/30.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was another birthday puzzle in a very similar style as the original beloved throw-back foods puzzle. This one depicted a bunch of pop culture references that were quite foreign to me, but fun to put together!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/31.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was these cute, albeit questionably Italian, lions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/32.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After the lions we dove back into the European architecture bandwagon.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/33.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
For being from the same box of puzzles, all ten of our deluxe puzzles has surprisingly different quality in terms of the pieces and their cuts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/34.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
I found this one another example of poor image quality leading to poor puzzling experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/35.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Slowly, but steadily we made our way through our European tour. Having done a significant portion more of 1000 piece puzzles prior to this, the 750 and 500s flew by.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/36.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The Colosseum was a particularly fun architectural puzzle given its archways patterns to put together. I don’t have a good photo of my mom and I here, since it was so dark when we went for the “night tour”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/37.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next we moved on to the deluxe puzzle art item. This had another rather monotonous background that scared me off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/38.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was another Goodwill puzzle featuring some lions. When viewed from the top it’s quite nice, but the bottom reveals quite a quantity of missing pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/39.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next was another Goodwill of a nice house scene.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/40.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
From here we moved to another medium quality Goodwill puzzle. I particularly enjoyed the photo of the bridge on this puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/41.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Up next was this colorful houses puzzle. It was a fun and colorful puzzle to put together; however, it had one of the most bizarre flaws I’vee seen in a puzzle. Two of it’s pieces fit together perfectly; however, the image in those pieces did not fit together. Try and see if you can spot the misalignment! If not I’ll spoil it after the next image</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/42.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Spoiler alert: the previous puzzle’s misalignment was on the left side of the puzzle on the yellow house, both lower windows are completely misaligned at the top.</p>

<p>This next puzzle was very cute and endearing to work on. It featured a number of cute critters and plants. The distinctiveness of all the elements made it a breeze.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/43.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
I love working on this Goodwill puzzle in particular with its lovely curving staircase. Putting together those stairs was overwhelmingly enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/44.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After I started the border on this Goodwill puzzle, I immediately wanted to quit based on the volume of missing pieces, but I’m glad my mom is tougher than me, for she persisted. Shortly after the completion of this puzzle, Biden won the 2020 election. We drove around Grand Haven with our Biden sign celebrating. Two ~10 year old boys on bicycles booed us as we drove past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/45.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up we had this lovely, lazy sloth boy, surrounding by eye-catchingly colorful forrest friends.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/46.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After that we started working on this gorgeous dolphin puzzle. For me it feels obvious looking back on these photos which puzzles are high quality or not, but I realize that may not be the case for everyone. This puzzle in particular was really enjoyable to put together. The stark orange of the goldfish creates such a fun pocket of color.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/47.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
On this image, saved as my lucky number 47 in my photos, it seems only fitting that it’s a satirical puzzle about the city of Chicago. For some additional very important context, when I was growing up Nickelodeon was on channel 46 and Cartoon Network was on channel 47. I hope it’s clear what kind of kid I was! Codename: Kids Next Door and Teen Titans for life!</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed this puzzle due to the thickness of the material used in the pieces, nearly a centimeter tall. They fit together in a similar way to wooden puzzles, shifting and expanding in relation to one another. It creates that ever satisfying ‘slide in’ effect when you add a piece to an area surrounded by pieces and it hugs the new piece snugly as it shimmies in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/48.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After this we worked on a Noah’s Ark puzzle, which I was somewhat conflicted about purchasing doing to its religious themes; however, I figured that buying it for $1 from Goodwill did not actually correlate any of my money being sent to the puzzle’s manufacturers. Besides, the image itself was quite lovely and varied, making it a joy to work on. The pieces were also incredibly varied.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/49.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was another truly bizarre puzzle that made me question the motivations of its creation. Luckily, this time my questions could be answered! This Goodwill puzzle contained the original sheets of paper included in the box at the time of sale, which include a detailed description of the artist and his work. The artist was deeply impacted by Africa specifically, especially with regards to environmental issues and viewed his art as a way to make a spiritual connection with the earth. For a white guy in the 70s, i caught me by surprise.</p>

<p>The fact sheet also contained a number to call to learn more about the artist. If you’ve read thus far, I’m certain you can guess that our quarantine boredom combined with insatiable curiosity led us to call the number. It was miraculously still in service and went to a recording of an art agency detailing to call back during alternative hours to learn more.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/50.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was provided by my mother’s alma mater, University of Chicago Law School for her contributions to their programs. I quite enjoyed working on the plaid skirts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/51.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was, as you can imagine, a very quick speed run. But given our love for Baby Yoda, combined with Goodwill’s $1 price tag, we couldn’t help ourselves. I actually quite enjoyed the size and shape of the pieces for this puzzle. Most larger “adult” puzzles tend to have less piece shape variety and therefore lack a tactile element that this puzzle provided.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/52.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was a Christmas gift from my brother to my Mom from Marshall’s. Our cat’s butt can be spotted to the right. Being an off brand puzzle, it wasn’t particularly high quality. The buildings really blended together, but the lettering to spell out Harry Potter was very fun to put together. Harry Potter was a huge deal for my family growing up. We went to a party at our local library the night the 7th book came out and read the first chapter together that night. It saddens me to have the positive memories dampened by the books’ author’s irrational transphobic views.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/53.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was a very fun puzzle, a Ravensburger Escape Room Puzzle - such a fun concept. The puzzle comes with a short story to provide context and has, hidden within it, several puzzle games that need to be solved. You’ll likely notice some distinctive symbols and patterns in the image. The next photo contains a spoiler of how these puzzles work, so scroll at your own risk!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/54.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Essentially each game’s outcome is a unique number and the numbers correspond to various edge pieces, which fit together to create a laser used to blow up a meteor to stop it from destroying earth! I think it’s a very cute concept, but I had to rely heavily on the hints. It was pretty difficult to determine the bounds of the math puzzles, as for several I could come up with multiple possible solutions. Additional, I think the laser creating solve was a bit obvious when assembling the puzzle, given how much trouble the edge pieces gave me when putting together. Since they have to fit with other edge pieces to eventually form the laser this makes sense, but unfortunately made it quite obvious to me early on. Overall I think this could be a fun family activity, especially with kids!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/55.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was an eeBoo puzzle given to my Mom from me. This lovely rooftop balcony garden was a joy to fit together. The puzzle was of excellent quality and the separate sections were very nice to put together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/56.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was also a Christmas gift to my Mom from my Dad, representing his favorites things in the world: books! This puzzle was also unusual in the the puzzle pieces were cut on wood, but very thin wood. It felt more like a regular puzzle than a wooden one in terms of fit, but the pieces clung to each other very closes and were very sturdy. I picked up this entire puzzle and rolled it into a spy glass without losing any pieces! I particularly enjoyed working on the book shelves in this puzzle. By searching for relatively straight shelves I was able to construct the middle section and then proceed outward by adding pieces with increasingly shelves.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/57.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was also chosen by my Dad for my Mom and I, and amazingly managed to outdo his last puzzle in terms of representing his favorites things – he know had books and cats represented! This puzzle was surprisingly challenging given how distinctly colored the sections of books appeared to be. It turned out to be trickier to determine the placement than at first glance. This was the last puzzle I did in Chicago in early 2021 before returning to San Francisco.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/58.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was found at a Little Free Library a block away from my apartment in San Francisco. It was of unbelievably poor quality and made me desperately hungry for a more appealing donut, as the one depicted look, quite frankly, potentially disappointing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/59.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was a gift from my Dad and was extremely difficult, I was ready to give after just doing the border but I persisted. It was on the same lovely thin wood at the large bookshelf puzzle he got us during the holidays.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/60.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The next puzzle I did was a classic Buffalo, an excellent American brand. I later watched a video about Buffalo discussing what a surge they saw during the pandemic and how some of their artists go about selecting good balance for images for puzzles. A good balance is indeed key to a good puzzling experience. I’ll write more on my opinions about what makes a good puzzle later on. This particular puzzle I decided to do on my carpet because I wanted to lean against my couch. I did not do this again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/61.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle is a National Geographic made puzzle and was sent to me by my Dad after a conversation in which he was embarrassed to learn of my lack of geographic knowledge. It was quite enjoyable putting this together without looking up any locations of cities of countries. I actually think I did quite well assembling all the land masses on that basis. I really enjoy the variety of shapes in this puzzle’s pieces as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/62.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was another gift from my Dad. His love for books knows no bounds. I really liked working on the same triangular flags on this puzzle. I also really appreciate the softness of the art style in this puzzle. Often to much blur leads to a poor puzzling experience, but this one struck just the right note.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/63.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was another gift from my Dad. I think he wanted to keep me busy being back in SF all alone again, but goodness did I love this puzzle. This and the previous one were both Ravensburgers and this one was particularly fun in its representation of such a wide cast of characters. While I adore the image, I do think it airs on the side of too much chaos for a puzzle, making it difficult to identify distinct sections to work on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/64.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After the last few puzzles, I was feeling a little bored at how quickly I was completing puzzles and decided I needed a new challenge. Since the largest puzzle I’d done previously was 1500 pieces, I thought why not double it? So i bought myself this gorgeous, but highly chaotic puzzle depicting buildings , monuments, and landmarks around the world. Hand is for scale! The following photos will include some progress pics as I worked my way through this bad boy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/65.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This was a full day of puzzling just to get the sorting completed Initially I started by separating out the sky area since it was the most distinct area.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/66.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
On day 2, I mostly focused on assembling the sky region, which took most of the day. After that I started sorting and assembling some other distinct sections.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/67.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The next day I worked on the puzzle was the Saturday of the next weekend. Puzzling was mainly a weekend morning/afternoon activity for me, as I usually was busy with work during the hours that got the best daylight. Speaking of which, good lighting is key to an successful puzzle assembly experience. On this day I accomplished more sections, built out the sky further and began sorting the increasingly terrifying quantity of pieces that did not yet fit into a distinct section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/68.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This progress photo had by far the most work go into it. It was no easy task to make progress on so many pieces without distinct indicators, such as color, image, or texture. I felt very accomplished at the end of this day, but honestly the hardest part of the remaining tan and green pieces still lay ahead. For me those finally puzzling moments were the most tedious as it was mostly a lot of back and forth. One particularly tricky thing about this puzzle was it’s sheer size often required me to sit on it in the middle while working on it. Since many tan pieces could go anywhere on the puzzle it was hard to test their fit across the puzzle without constantly getting up and repositioning or reaching very far.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/69.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The final product - my labor of love!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/70.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
I couldn’t raise my phone high enough when taking this photo to even capture the entire puzzle - that’s how huge it is! The journey certainly had its highs and lows, but I’m very glad I did it. In many ways puzzles have taught me persistance when I would otherwise want to quit. A lot of people asked me how long it took and I’m regretful I didn’t time it, but I’d estimate 20-30 hours total.</p>

After my 3000 piece puzzle I ddi take a long break, before tackling this somewhat confusingly themed 1000 piece Ravensburger. I think the title related to crafting as its primary motifs, but as you can see, there’s some weird stuff in there.</p>

Next up I brought this Star Wars puzzle with me on a trip with some friends to LA. It was my first vacation since being vaccinated and I went to DisneyLand for the first time, which I was surprised to discover I quite enjoyed - I especially loved the new Star Wars Rise of the Resistance ride! My friends and I worked on this puzzle during evening but were unable to complete it in LA. I slid the partially done sections onto pieces of paper and stacked them and cross my fingers for the drive home. It worked splendidly, and all our work was successfully preserved. I completed the puzzle shortly after and shared with my friends to celebrate.</p>

<p>I know this is a controversial opinion but I loved the new Star Wars films, and not just because of their representation. I liked the expansion of Force powers represented and the themes it handled, especially focused on people not being wholly good or evil.</p>

Next up was this fun patterned sock puzzle! Puzzles like this are really great for everyone. They’re very easy to separate out distinct working areas and the patterns are straightforward to put together. I did this puzzle while visiting my family in summer of 2021.</p>

Next up was this old fashioned tea party. The art style had a sort weird element of realism that I personally found somewhat off putting. I thought it made the food appear almost unappetizing, but it was still a fun puzzle to work on!</p>

After that I moved onto this lovely Tiki bar scene. Putting all the drinks together for this puzzle was very fun. Apologies for my poor camera work in taking this photo.</p>

This next puzzle greatly appealed to me at first; however, the long I stared at the milk running down the stares, the more it seemed to ooze like slime. I really enjoyed putting the milk bottles together though.</p>

This next puzzle’s name is Cassie, and she is too smart for her own good. She quickly learned that my mom and I were deeply invested in puzzles and realized the best way to steal our attention was to sit on them and even worse play with the pieces - sometimes undoing hours of work! But she is so darned cute, we forgive her.</p>

Here’s the completed version of this pastel styled cat puzzle that my cat was disrupting. I didn’t love the feel of these pieces, but these did have some excellent, unique shapes.</p>

<p>I would also like to note that my mom and I have re-donated the vast majority of the puzzles here back to Goodwill. We only kept the puzzles given as gifts or bought for special reasons as memories to one day be re-done. For all the other puzzles, we wanted to ensure they get put back into the system. I wonder if there are other folks like us who ransack the Goodwill puzzles section every once in a blue moon.</p>
