I"q<p>This blog post discusses the difference between content and subject matter of Paulâ€™s Simonâ€™s <em>You Can Call Me Al</em>.</p>

<p>The subject matter of the song tells a disjointed story of human existence from the perspective of a man. The literal lyrics seem rather nonsensical, particularly the refrain where the singer suggests if youâ€™ll be my bodyguard, I can call you Betty and you can call me Al, although the singer of the song is named Paul.</p>

<p>The content of the song is where things get rather interested. Essentially a man reflects on his existence and wants to elevate himself above his regular boring existence. Thereâ€™s definitely some spiritual insinuations, especially in the last verse where he sings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ðŸŽ¶
  He looks around, around
  He sees angels in the architecture
  Spinning in infinity
  He says Amen! and Hallelujah!
ðŸŽ¶
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>He spends the first two verses questioning human existence and its sins through lines like <em>He says why am I soft in the middle now,</em> <em>He says why am I short of attention,</em> and <em>Whereâ€™s my wife and family.</em></p>

<p>The final verse he describes a scene where the man is in a foreign land, unfamiliar territory. Through this foreign or perhaps spriitual environment he is able to see angels in the architecture.</p>
