I"ô<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Bex.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer and artist seeking to make the world a better place through open source and the uplifting of underrepresented groups in tech.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked at GitHub for a bit, and created <a href="https://github.com/behaviorbot">behaviorbot</a> and maintain and build <a href="https://probot.github.io/">probot</a>.</p>

<p>Check out a <a href="https://vimeo.com/287507595">talk I gave about Probot</a></p>

<p>All artwork belongs to me.
