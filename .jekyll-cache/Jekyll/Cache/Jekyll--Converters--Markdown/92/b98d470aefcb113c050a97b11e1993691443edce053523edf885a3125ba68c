I"cE<p>Hello and happy almost 2022! I wanted to document and share my journey of becoming obsessed with puzzling during the pandemic. Since then I have completed nearly 100 jigsaw puzzles, primarily around 1000 pieces each. What started as a way to kill time, turned into a love and joy for the simple act of solving jigsaw puzzles. From discovering that Goodwill in Michigan sells puzzles for $1 to pulling relics from the back of my childhood home’s attic, this experience has been nothing short of wonderful since the beginning.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell this story with photos of the puzzles I’ve completed as well as some memories made along the way. It is quite long since it includes nearly a hundred photographs of puzzles, but I highly recommend for some rainy day entertainment.</p>

<br />
As a kid I did make puzzles, but this puzzle was the first one I completed in March of 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. I was living alone in San Francisco and very afraid of Covid-19. I spent almost no time outside of my apartment and decided to order two 1000 piece puzzles on Amazon to have something to do. I loved this puzzle given the variety of color and texture. It made for an excellent return/start to puzzling.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/2.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
If you can’t tell by now, I do quite like cats. This was the second puzzle from my Amazon delivery, and I really enjoyed the beach time vibes. The colors and unique elements made it highly enjoyable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/3.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This puzzle was one of the more unique ones I’ve done. It was a puzzle my family owned since I was a child, and my parents mailed it to me as a “covid relief” care package to lift my spirits. I’m not sure where we got it, but it is entirely holographic, meaning the kites appear to shift as you move it. This does not make for a particularly easy puzzling experience, but it certainly is fun to look at!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/4.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Not long after completing the holographic puzzle, I made the difficult decision in May of 2020 to return home for my mental and emotional well being. Living alone during the pandemic was extremely difficult for me. I was also lucky that my job was fully remote and supported me in this temporary relocation. This throw-back foods puzzle was the first I did in Grand Haven with my mom. It belonged to my Aunt and she left us borrow and complete it. It was fun hearing from my mom which of these foods she loved growing up, since many were unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/5.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was also a loaner from my Aunt and a lovely sea-scape. This one was actually a bit tricky given the blue regions that are difficult to distinguish, but nothing some determination couldn’t tackle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/6.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This 1500 piece black and white puzzle of the art of M. C. Escher almost broke me. This was far and away the largest and most difficult puzzle I had done to date. An addition of 500 pieces, might not seem like much, but that combined with the lack of color and lack of distinct sections made for an extremely difficult puzzle. The bottom 1/3 we completed relatively quickly, but those birds fading into the sky because quite a drawn out process. The image itself is lovely. It is a reflection of itself in inverted black and white colors, creating a fascinating illusion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/7.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After the pain that was the Escher puzzle, we relaxed with this smaller 500 piece beach chair puzzle. Each chair was only a dozen or so pieces, making for quick, satisfying work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/8.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Up next was a puzzle I believe was brought back to my Aunt from my cousin after her semester abroad in Dublin. It depicts a lovely coast; however, the actual image quality of the printing on the puzzle was quite poor, leading to intense pixelation that made puzzling slower.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/9.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was one I had spotted on my Aunt’s shelf and been particularly excited to borrow. It depicts a crowded snowy downtown which I thought was lovely. It was great fun getting to put together all the highly patterned buildings and place the people in the correct positions as we built out the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/10.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next candy puzzle was also borrowed from my Aunt - she had quite a nice collection we got to complete!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/11.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was the first puzzle we did after we ran out of convenient family-supplied puzzles. This was also our first Ravensburger puzzle, a brand that, amongst puzzlers, carries a great deal of respect and weight. Ravensburger puzzles are very consistent and very high quality. This particular one, although its photo does not do it justice, represented a very humours book store, with dozens of funny phrasings available to be read on even the tiniest of books. It was quite amusing when putting it together to read something like “Cure for Bats” and have the rest of the joke be cut off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/12.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Shortly after completing our first Ravensburger, my mom had the brilliant idea to hit up the Grand Haven Goodwill to search for some less expense options for puzzles. It is rather difficult to justify spending $20-30 for a puzzle with the intention of only completing it once. At this point it might be important to point out that our family has no tradition of gluing or framing puzzles and we tend to take them apart as soon as they’ve sat finished for day. We also do not subscribe to the bizarre, fringe group of puzzle who believe using the box is “cheating”.</p>

<p>This was our first official puzzle “haul” – we should have made an unboxing video! The bizarreness of this particular grouping of puzzles will hopefully not go unnoticed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/13.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After much discussion, we selected one of the simpler landscape puzzles to complete first. These puzzles aren’t really my favorites. I find the images rather unimaginative and the process for putting them together rather tedious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/14.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up came another Amazon delivery of a 500 piece Baby Yoda puzzle! It was immediately prioritized above the Goodwill puzzles. At the time the Mandalorian had just come out and my mom and I were rightfully obsessed with Baby Yoda. This puzzle was fun, but unfortunately the image quality was very low, resulting in some pretty dreadful levels of pixelation in the printed puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/15.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The next puzzle was certainly a legendary one and left me questioning many things about the universe. Who decides what goes on a puzzle? Do those people get paid? Is the person who picked the image for this puzzle different than the person responsible for the text selection? Did they ever meet one another? Would they have been friends or mortal enemies? These are very important questions for which we, unfortunately, never received answers. All I can hope is that the poor squirrel in the image is not as overworked as the corporate American I image screaming that diatribe.</p>

<p>This puzzle was also hair pulling-ly difficult Every single piece was identical and fit together with every other piece. I can’t tell you how many mistakes we had to undo and fix halfway through a section. Even at the end I remained convinced that there was a mistake in the top left quadrant. If you look closely at the orange and black areas, doesn’t something just seem… off?</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/16.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was completed on a folding card table during a brief weekend back in Chicago.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/17.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was another from the Goodwill batch and completed back in Grand Haven. It was our first (but certainly not last) used puzzle that we found to have missing pieces. A lot of people did ask me if Goodwill puzzles could be trusted at all to have pieces, and I will say that the vast majority of puzzles we got from Goodwill were entirely complete, and there were very few with truly egregious amounts of missing pieces. This particular puzzle was fun initially to build the tree trunks up, but quickly became a tedious guess and check effort to fill in the remaining forestry.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/18.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Up next was a childhood favorite brought from our pantry. We have no records of when we misplaced that single piece and are highly distraught over that loss. Lord of the Rings was an obsession amongst the whole family growing up. I was thoroughly shamed for being the only one not to have read the books.</p>

<p>I remember when I was young and the final Lord of the Rings movie came out, my parents had to see it in theaters without my brother and I to decide if we would be allowed to see it. At 10 and 6 respectively, we saw the Return of the King in theaters. Quite frankly I watched a lot of movies that perhaps I was too young for, but Lord of the Rings didn’t leave much of an impression. The Matrix on the other hand did. Apparently 5 year old me watched the opening scene and turned to my dad and said, wide-eyed, “she’s <em>GOOD</em>”. Trinity was, indeed, good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/19.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle is also one of the ones which posses an image that evokes an unexpected sense of existentialism. Its meaning goes over my head; however, its ghost wolves were certainly fun to put together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/20.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next beautifully horsey was primarily worked on by my mom, as I found the background disillusioning to work on. This was unfortunately another Goodwill puzzle with several missing pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/21.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Here’s a sneak peak of our summer puzzle stack that year, which was nearly completed, prompting another Goodwill visit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/22.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
And boy oh boy did this particular Goodwill visit blow my mind!! Did anyone else in the universe know that they sold puzzle PACKS that contained multiple unique puzzles! This was an absolutely revolutionary discovery that really changed my outlook on puzzling.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/23.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Here’s what the inside of the legendary 10 Deluxe Jigsaw Puzzles box looked like. Not all of the puzzles were opened by the previous owner, but there were a few loose pieces floating around. We did find all the pieces for all of these puzzles and were left scratching our heads with an extra!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/24.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
The same Goodwill trip that provided the 10 deluxe puzzle pack, also brought home this adorable treasure, only 500 pieces I chose to work on this one first since I adored the frame it had.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/25.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
My first pick of the deluxe box was this somewhat bizarrely organized image featuring various European (primarily Italian, but not exclusively) motifs. I liked the idea of all the different unique sections, but frankly it made for too easy of a puzzle and was completed before I knew it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/26.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up was another house puzzle that features some highly questionable roofing architecture. I mean look closely, it really is confusing - every house has a different connection element and even slightly different initial roof heights.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/27.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up we took on the Milan Duomo. Now I have been to the Milan Duomo and highly question the caption’s accuracy given there is no bridge leading up to the Duomo. Some googling led me to discover that this is in fact a terrace and you can go up there - missing opportunity for me. This one was rather tedious as well given the giant mass of blue sky and repetitive pilar structures.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/28.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up is an interruption in the deluxe puzzle series due to a birthday gift for my mom in September. I remembered how much she enjoyed the first old-timey food puzzle, so I picked this one out. This puzzle was memorable for its unique puzzle piece shapes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/29.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next we returned to Italy for the poorly photographed Trevi Fountain. Here’s an obligatory photo of my mom and I at the Trevi Fountain together.
