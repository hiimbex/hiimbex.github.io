I"ý<p>Hello and happy almost 2022! I wanted to document and share my journey of becoming obsessed with puzzling during the pandemic. Since then I have completed over 75 1000 pieces+ jigsaw puzzles. What started as a way to kill time, turned into a love and joy for the simple act of solving jigsaw puzzles. From discovering that Goodwill in Michigan sells puzzles for $1 to pulling relics from the back of my childhood homeâ€™s attic, this experience has been nothing short of wonderful since the beginning.</p>
