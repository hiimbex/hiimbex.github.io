I"1<p>Hello and happy almost 2022! I wanted to document and share my journey of becoming obsessed with puzzling during the pandemic. Since then I have completed nearly 100 jigsaw puzzles, primarily around 1000 pieces each. What started as a way to kill time, turned into a love and joy for the simple act of solving jigsaw puzzles. From discovering that Goodwill in Michigan sells puzzles for $1 to pulling relics from the back of my childhood home’s attic, this experience has been nothing short of wonderful since the beginning.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell this story with photos of the puzzles I’ve completed as well as some memories made along the way. It is quite long since it includes nearly a hundred photographs of puzzles, but I highly recommend for some rainy day entertainment.</p>

<br />
As a kid I did make puzzles, but this puzzle was the first one I completed in March of 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. I was living alone in San Francisco and very afraid of Covid-19. I spent almost no time outside of my apartment and decided to order 2 1000 piece puzzles on Amazon to have something to do. I loved this puzzle given the variety of color and texture. It made for an excellent return/start to puzzling.</p>

<br />
If you can’t tell by now, I do quite like cats. This was the second puzzle from my Amazon delivery, and I really enjoyed the beach time vibes. The colors and unique elements made it highly enjoyable.</p>

<br />
This puzzle was one of the more unique ones I’ve done. It was a puzzle my family owned since I was a child, and my parents mailed it to me as a “covid relief” care package to lift my spirits. I’m not sure where we got it, but it is entirely holographic, meaning the kites appear to shift as you move it. This does not make for a particularly easy puzzling experience, but it certainly is fun to look at!</p>

<br />
Not long after completing the holographic puzzle, I made the difficult decision in May of 2020 to return home for my mental and emotional well being. Living alone during the pandemic was extremely difficult for me. I was also lucky that my job was fully remote and supported me in this temporary relocation. This throw-back foods puzzle was the first I did in Grand Haven with my mom. It belonged to my Aunt and she left us borrow and complete it. It was fun hearing from my mom which of these foods she loved growing up, since many were unfamiliar to me.</p>

<br />
This next puzzle was also a loaner from my Aunt and a lovely sea-scape. This one was actually a bit tricky given the blue regions that are difficult to distinguish, but nothing some determination couldn’t tackle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/6.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This 1500 piece black and white puzzle of the art of M. C. Escher almost broke me. This was far and away the largest and most difficult puzzle I had done to date. An addition of 500 pieces, might not seem like much, but that combined with the lack of color and lack of distinct sections made for an extremely difficult puzzle. The bottom 1/3 we completed relatively quickly, but those birds fading into the sky because quite a drawn out process. The image itself is lovely. It is a reflection of itself in inverted black and white colors, creating a fascinating illusion.</p>

<br />
After the pain that was the Escher puzzle, we relaxed with this smaller 500 piece beach chair puzzle. Each chair was only a dozen or so pieces, making for quick, satisfying work.</p>

<br />
Up next was a puzzle I believe was brought back to my Aunt from my cousin after her semester abroad in Dublin. It depicts a lovely coast; however, the actual image quality of the printing on the puzzle was quite poor, leading to intense pixelation that made puzzling slower.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/9.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was one I had spotted on my Aunt’s shelf and been particularly excited to borrow. It depicts a crowded snowy downtown which I thought was lovely. It was great fun getting to put together all the highly patterned buildings and place the people in the correct positions as we built out the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/10.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next candy puzzle was also borrowed from my Aunt - she had quite a nice collection we got to complete!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/11.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
This next puzzle was the first puzzle we did after we ran out of convenient family-supplied puzzles. This was also our first Ravensburger puzzle, a brand that, amongst puzzlers, carries a great deal of respect and weight. Ravensburger puzzles are very consistent and very high quality. This particular one, although its photo does not do it justice, represented a very humours book store, with dozens of funny phrasings available to be read on even the tiniest of books. It was quite amusing when putting it together to read something like “Cure for Bats” and have the rest of the joke be cut off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/12.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Shortly after completing our first Ravensburger, my mom had the brilliant idea to hit up the Grand Haven Goodwill to search for some less expense options for puzzles. It is rather difficult to justify spending $20-30 for a puzzle with the intention of only completing it once. At this point it might be important to point out that our family has no tradition of gluing or framing puzzles and we tend to take them apart as soon as they’ve sat finished for day. We also do not subscribe to the bizarre, fringe group of puzzle who believe using the box is “cheating”.</p>

<p>This was our first official puzzle “haul” – we should have made an unboxing video! The bizarreness of this particular grouping of puzzles will hopefully not go unnoticed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/13.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
After much discussion, we selected one of the simpler landscape puzzles to complete first. These puzzles aren’t really my favorites. I find the images rather unimaginative and the process for putting them together rather tedious.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/puzzles/14.JPG" style="width:950px;" />
<br />
Next up came another Amazon delivery of a 500 piece Baby Yoda puzzle! It was immediately prioritized above the Goodwill puzzles. At the time the Mandalorian had just come out and my mom and I were rightfully obsessed with Baby Yoda. This puzzle was fun, but unfortunately the image quality was very low, resulting in some pretty dreadful levles of pixelation in the printed puzzle.</p>
